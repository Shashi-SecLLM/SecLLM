# SecLLM: From design to deployment, Copilot empowers security engineers to secure the entire product lifecycle.

## Introduction

SecLLM is an innovative open-source project that empowers product security engineers by streamlining security activities throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Leveraging the power of artificial intelligence (AI), SecLLM acts as a virtual co-pilot, intelligently assisting engineers in generating security requirements and controls.

## Key Features

AI-Powered Security Requirements Generation: SecLLM utilizes state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) and generative AI models to analyze solution architecture, high-level software requirements, and existing enterprise security controls. Based on this analysis, SecLLM generates tailored security requirements, reducing manual effort and improving efficiency.
Intelligent AI Integration: Built with Vertex AI, SecLLM seamlessly integrates advanced AI capabilities. This enables intelligent interpretation and analysis of complex security needs, allowing engineers to focus on higher-level security strategies.
